# Unit 10 OOP: Template Engine - Employee Summary

## Description

This week I was tasked to create a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Using jest,
I was to ensure that all the given tests pass before creating the functionality. Using inquirer all employees would be asked for their name, id, email, and role. Depending on their role, employees were asked for their github (Engineers), school (Interns), and office number (Managers). I had to make sure to export and require all appropriate modules, including questions, and functions I had tested. All role based functions had to inherit from the Employee class. Also, I validated all answers so that no answer would prompt a message.

## Installation Requirements

* Node.js 
* Inquirer

After cloning this repository to your computer, open the terminal in 'app.js' 
and type:

```
npm install
```
This will download all modules. You are almost ready!

## Usage

For users who want to keep track of employees, this app is perfect. It prompts questions about your employees and creates a page that you can revisit to see their school, github username, and email, among other things.

## Tests

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```
node app.js
```

**make sure you are in the root directory!**
